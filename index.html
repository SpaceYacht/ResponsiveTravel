            <h2>Location Details</h2>

            <p>
              The Starbase is located in Boca Chica which lies on the southern tip of Texas, on the Eastern portion of Cameron County (Soon to be Starbase, TX.)<br>
              <br>Since 2014 Boca Chica has been home to a Starport owned and operated by Elon Musk's private space exploration company, SpaceX.<br>
              <br>Boca Chica is also home to a Civil War battlefield: The Battle of Pamito Ranch, which some consider the final battle of the war.
              <br>However, this is boring and has nothing to do with space so best to stick with visiting the starport.
